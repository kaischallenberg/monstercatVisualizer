# monstercatVisualizer
An HTML/JS-based audio visualizer

This visualizer is intended to resemble the one in the official Monstercat videos.
The project https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer is used for this.

To test it, you need to add an audio file and change the path in the HTML. Otherwise, simply rename the audio file "Podcast.mp3."

The videos below are not pre-rendered.

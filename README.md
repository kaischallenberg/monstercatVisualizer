# monstercatVisualizer
An HTML/JS-based audio visualizer

This visualizer is intended to resemble the one in the official Monstercat videos.
The project [audioMotion-analyzer](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion-analyzer) is used for this.


# Install
To get this running, you need a local web server. The easiest way to do this is with Visual Studio Code and the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Opening the HTML without a web server will cause Cors to have problems opening the songs.

Insert your songs into the `./audio/` folder, add a suitable cover image to `./cover/`, and adjust the `./settings.js` file.

# Preview
The videos below are not pre-rendered.
